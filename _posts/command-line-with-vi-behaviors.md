title:  "Command Line with Vi Behaviors"
---

I am not a fan of vi. I do, however, recognize that it is the one editor I can count on to be on a *nix distribution so I am pretty good with it. I wanted my command line to allow me to edit in the same style. That meant adding the below line to my ~/.profile on Ubuntu Lucid:

set -o vi

I love this. Esc + ^ returns me to first character of the line. Esc + bbbbb jumps me back 5 words instead of having to go character by character. You get the idea.

What about the other CLI tools like the MySQL client? The Python interactive editor? Postgres client? Rubyâ€™s irb editor? Well it turns out that if the tool uses readline, then you can get the same convenience. In the file ~/.inputrc put the line:

set editing-mode vi

You can now navigate your command line client in vi-centric ways.

The idea for all this came from [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/9506/vi-in-mysql-for-command-editing).
