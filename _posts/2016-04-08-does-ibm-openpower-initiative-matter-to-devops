title:  "Does IBM's OpenPower Initiative Matter to DevOps"
---

My friend, Lynn Bender, Godfather of GeekAustin, recently asked me if I thought
there was a DevOps story in IBM's OpenPower initiative. I dug around a bit and
came up with these thoughs.

The short answer is, "No, not directly, and only if the promise of OpenPower 
is realized."

## TL;DR

IBM seems to be trying to figure out how to join the technology community 
without owning it.  It's an ongoing process, and I hope they can figure it out.
IBM matters, and bringing its brilliance to DevOps practice rather than DevOps
marketing would benefit everyone concerned.

The promise of OpenPower, to me, appears to be more about providing the next 
decades worth of hardware performance enhancements. This appears to be a direct 
play against Intel's stranglehold on today's chip market. 

Intel's rate of innovation has not kept up with demand while its prices have 
crept up relatively quickly over the last three years or so (for chips). 
The Power architecture has some interesting properties that allow it to perform 
better in certain areas. The one that jumps to mind is encryption.  
Given that security is the 900lb Gorilla right now, this could matter quite 
a bit.  Tech such as perfect forward secrecy (next wave of TLS/SSL)  is very 
computationally heavy.  

My memory is also that the Power instruction set is significantly simpler 
than the bolted-on-then-bolted-on some more of x86. This means that the 
companies in the OpenPower consortium who care to could potentially leverage 
this for optimizations that are not possible.  As I understand it Power is now 
little endian, thus Linux and its app ecosystem can run on it.

Since devops is really about how software is made and delivered to systems, 
I would say the connection is tenuous.  We DevOpsians would certainly love to 
deploy to more powerful systems, but in the end, we deploy to what is 
available and prefer cloud systems to all others.
