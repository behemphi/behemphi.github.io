title:  "Run Minecraft in a Container"
---

Want to be a hero to your kids this Christmas? Want your nerdyism to make you the coolest mom or dad in the neighborhood? What you neighbors thank you for providing a safe online environment for their kids to play minecraft?

Let's run a minecraft server using Docker in 5 minutes or less.

## Assumptions

This article assumes you have the following:

* The ability to stand up a CoreOs host in your favorite cloud
* The ability to work at a Linux command line 

It will help if you have:

* Some familiarity with Docker
* Some familiarity with SystemD

The article is inverted.  You will have the thing up and running, then we will 
dive in to the why and how of it.

## Be a Christmas Hero

Set up a container just for the data. 

```
docker run \
  --detach \
  --name mc-data-only \
  --volume /minecraft/WORLD  
  behemphi/docker-minecraft:1.8.6
```

Now run the minecraft server.

```
docker run \
  --detach \
  --env MOTD="My name is Dad and I am all-powerful." \
  --publish 25565:25565 \
  --volumes-from mc-data-only \
  behemphi/docker-minecraft:1.8.6
```
